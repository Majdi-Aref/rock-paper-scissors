- ## 6. 1. HTML

  - Using HTML, I created the content of the Rock Paper Scissor's website, made it accessible, and provided the relevant structure for search engine optimization.

- ## 6. 2. CSS

  - I utilized CSS to make the content of this game's website both visually appealing and responsive on different screen sizes of laptops, tabs, and smartphones.

- ## 6. 3. Codeanywhere

  - Codeanywhere is an efficient cloud-based integrated development environment that I employed to write, review, integrate, and deploy the HTML and CSS code of the Rock Paper Scissors website without any need for any installations or configurations.

- ## 6. 4. GitHub

  - A platform for version control and collaborative software development, which I exploited to create a central code repository for and deploy the website of Rock Paper Scissors game project; this, in turn, allows me to keep track of changes made to code and revert to previous versions if needed.

- ## 6. 5. Balsamiq

  - This is the program I applied to generate the framework of the website of the game project.

- ## 6. 6. Google Fonts

  - I resorted to Google Fonts to amplify the look of the Rock Paper Scissors' website, so I integrated two of its fonts into the website by inserting their links in their respective CSS file.
  - The "sans-serif" font has been integrated into the style.css file as a backup font.

- ## 6. 7. Font Awesome

  - To enhance the visual design of the game's website, I have turned to Font Awesome and incorporated 3 icons into it as the icons of the social media links in the footer.

- ## 6. 9. W3C HTML & CSS Validators

  - There exist two W3C validators: Online tools that check HTML and CSS code.
  - Exerising both of them, a developer can validate their code by URL, file upload, or direct input.
  - I have enacted both W3C validators to scrutinize the html and css files of the Rock Paper Scissors' website.
  - I executed two validation methods: by URL and by direct input.
  - Putting the validate-by-URL method to use, I have validated index.html file of the game.
  - Bringing the validate-by-direct-input method, I have validated the style.css file of the game.

- ## 6. 10. JSHint

  - JSHint is an online website that scrutinizes and validates JavaScript code.
  - Through direct input, I made use of JSHint to check and validate the script.js file of Rock Paper Scissors.

# 7. Code Validation

- ## 7. 1. index.html File

  - Using the W3C HTML validator, I checked the index.html file. No errors or warnings were shown.
  - Below are 2 screenshots that document this validation.

![Image 1 of the validation of the index.html file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-html-1.png)

![Image 2 of the validation of the index.html file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-html-2.png)

- ## 7. 2. style.css File

  - Applying the W3C CSS validator, I examined the style.css file with the help of the "direct input" method; no errors were found.
  - However, one warning was recorded: "Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes".
  - I took 2 screenshots of the CSS validation result, please have a look them lower down.

  - Using the terminal, create a readme.md file for your project.
  - Type in the Codeanywhere's terminal the command: "python3 -m http.server", a small window opens at the right bottom corner.
  - In that small window, click on "Browser"; this opens your Github's repository through your Codeanywhere's workspace in a browser in a new tab.
  - Press at that same time "Control + Shift + R" to refresh your browser.
  - Press at the same time "Control + S" to save the code you create in Codeanywhere's worksace; this will automatically save it in your applicable file in your Codeanywhere's workspaces.
