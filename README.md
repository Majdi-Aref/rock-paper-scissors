# Rock Paper Scissors

- "Rock Paper Scissors" is an implementation of the popular, time-honored game, "Rock Paper Scissors". People who like this kind of game, which depends on pure luck, will seek it as this game will entertain them.
- I developed Rock Paper Scissors as my Portfolio Project 2 for my full stack software development diploma with the Code Institute in Dublin, Ireland.

## 2. 4. Outcome Section

- The result of each round will be demonstrated at the top of this section in the "round result" paragraph.
- Below a round's result is the final result of a game that announces who won a game.
- Underneath the fianl result are a player's score and the computer's score, which specify how many rounds a player wins and how many rounds the computer wins.
- If a user wins a round, their score will be incremented by 1; similarly, if the computer wins a round, its score will be incremented by 1. If, however, the result of a round is"tie", the scores will remain the same.
- As soon as a user or the computer has won 10 rounds, the final result paragraph will broadcast that, articulate the winner of a game, and stir a user up to click on the "Reset & Play Again" button, which is both found and accentuated at the bottom of the outcome section, to have a go at a new game.
- Please view the images of the outcome section below.

# 3. Future Features

- I would incorporate several difficulty levels into the game.
- On top of that, I would develop the option of multiplayer; for example, between two users.

# 4. Typography & Color Scheme

- Three fonts from Google Fonts have been inserted into the style.css file: "Rampart One", "Fredoka", and "sans-serif".
- Two colors have been applied as font colors: #00008B and #ff4500.
- Two colors have been applied as background colors: #f0f8ff and #ffffe0.
- Three emojis from www.emojipedia.org have been utilized as the game buttons: "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
- Three icons from Font Awesome have been implemented as the social media icons: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

# 6. Technology

## 6. 1. HTML

- Using HTML, I created the content of the Rock Paper Scissor's website, made it accessible, and provided the relevant structure for search engine optimization.

## 6. 2. CSS

- I utilized CSS to make the content of this game's website both visually appealing and responsive on different screen sizes of laptops, tabs, and smartphones.

## 6. 3. JavaScript

- In order to create the logic of the game, I exploited JavaScript, especially its functions.
- I stored the JavaScipt logic of the game in a script.js file.

## 6. 4. Codeanywhere

- Codeanywhere is an efficient cloud-based integrated development environment that I employed to write, review, integrate, and deploy the code of the Rock Paper Scissors website without any need for any installations or configurations.

## 6. 5. GitHub

- A platform for version control and collaborative software development, which I exploited to create a central code repository for and deploy the website of Rock Paper Scissors game project; this, in turn, allows me to keep track of changes made to code and revert to previous versions if needed.

## 6. 6. Balsamiq

- This is the program I applied to generate the framework of the website of the game project.

## 6. 7. Google Fonts

- I resorted to Google Fonts to amplify the look of the Rock Paper Scissors' website, so I integrated two of its fonts into the website by inserting their links in their respective CSS file.
- The "sans-serif" font has been integrated into the style.css file as a backup font.

## 6. 8. Font Awesome

- To enhance the visual design of the game's website, I have turned to Font Awesome and incorporated 3 icons into it as the icons of the social media links in the footer.

## 6. 9. Emojipedia

- In order to enable the game buttons to encompass some pragmatic, quite beautiful emojis, I visited www.emojipedia.org and employed 3 of their emojis: "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

## 6. 10. W3C HTML & CSS Validators

- There exist two W3C validators: Online tools that check HTML and CSS code.
- Exercising both of them, a developer can validate their code by URL, file upload, or direct input.
- I have enacted both W3C validators to scrutinize the html and css files of the Rock Paper Scissors' website.
- I executed only one validation method: by direct input.

## 6. 11. JSHint

- JSHint is an online website that scrutinizes and validates JavaScript code.
- Through direct input, I made use of JSHint to check and validate the script.js file of Rock Paper Scissors.

# 7. Code Validation

## 7. 1. index.html File

- Using the W3C HTML validator, I checked the index.html file. No errors or warnings were shown.
- Below are 2 screenshots that document this validation.

![Image 1 of the validation of the index.html file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-html-1.png)

![Image 2 of the validation of the index.html file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-html-2.png)

## 7. 2. style.css File

- Applying the W3C CSS validator, I examined the style.css file with the help of the "direct input" method; no errors were found.
- However, one warning was recorded: "Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes".
- I took 2 screenshots of the CSS validation result, please have a look at them lower down.

![Image 1 of the validation of the style.css file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-css-1.png)

![Image 1 of the validation of the style.css file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-css-2.png)

## 7. 3. script.js File

- Taking advantage of JSHint, I validated the script.js file of the game; 17 warnings were issued.
- Kindly inspect the 4 images of this validation further down.

![Image 1 of the validation of the script.js file](assets/images/readme-code-validation-js-1.png)
